# Project3_Group1

Chosen Topic: 
A competitive shop “comp shop” of a competitor’s high-end fashion e-commerce site to analyze product listing category counts, brand counts by listings, and min., max., and average retail prices within the top 5 product categories.  

For this project, our group will imagine ourselves as the data analysis/marketing team for a competitive company for the online retailer clothing store, SSENSE. To limit the amount of runtime considering that the website hosts tens of thousands of product listings, only womenswear (jeans and tshirts) products from the U.S. site will be scraped. The final goal of collecting this data is to decide what categories and brands of clothing are most prominent in our competitor’s inventory, and how to best price certain items in our comp shop.
